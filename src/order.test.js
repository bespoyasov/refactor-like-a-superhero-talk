/**
 * Again, for brevity we keep only a few tests.
 * Just to show how much easier the testing got:
 *
 * - no need to mock global objects;
 * - no need to mock any 3rd-party services
 *   (thanks to adapters and the anti-corruption layer);
 * - no need to render the component,
 *   we can test the use case function as a function.
